Continents is a small add-on datapack to reshape the world so that landmasses are further apart, varying in size and shape.

## Notes
- Continents is compatible with most worldgen datapacks, including Terralith
- Large Biomes works with this - unless Terralith or another similar datapack is installed

## Description
One of the most popular requests we've seen, Continents lets you sail massive oceans, and stumble across huge continents. In between continents are plenty of islands to keep your sailing interesting. When you spawn in your world, you are guarenteed to always spawn on a medium-sized continent, which averages around 1k blocks in size.
